Hough Space is a polar coordinate system 


we need to teach the computer which points are on an circle 

Hough Transform Theory:

- represent points in a polar coordinate system

r = x.cos(A) + y.sin(A)

- every point can be translated into an R and A
- (same gradient)every point on the same line with translate into the same R and A
- iterate for loads of R by [1-180] angle
- but in an array bin[R, A]
